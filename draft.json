But Ben Hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty-two kings who helped him. 17 The young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben Hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, \u201cMen are coming out from Samaria.\u201d<br><br>18 He said, \u201cIf they have come out for peace, take them alive; or if they have come out for war, take them alive.\u201d<br><br>19 So these went out of the city, the young men of the princes of the provinces, and the army which followed them. 20 They each killed his man. The Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them. Ben Hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with horsemen. 21 The king of Israel went out, and struck the horses and chariots, and killed the Syrians with a great slaughter. 22 The prophet came near to the king of Israel, and said to him, \u201cGo, strengthen yourself, and mark, and see what you do; for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against you.\u201d<br><br>23 The servants of the king of Syria said to him, \u201cTheir god is a god of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we.

The people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. 44 Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel. 45 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he fought, aren\u2019t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 46 The remnant of the sodomites, that remained in the days of his father Asa, he put away out of the land. 47 There was no king in Edom. A deputy ruled. 48 Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold, but they didn\u2019t go; for the ships wrecked at Ezion Geber. 49 Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, \u201cLet my servants go with your servants in the ships.\u201d But Jehoshaphat would not. 50 Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in his father David\u2019s city. Jehoram his son reigned in his place.<br><br>51 Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel. 52 He did that which was evil in Yahweh\u2019s sight, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, in which he made Israel to sin. 53 He served Baal and worshiped him, and provoked Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger in all the ways that his father had done so.<br><br><b>2 Kings 1:1-18</b><br>Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab. 2 Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper room that was in Samaria, and was sick. So he sent messengers, and said to them, \u201cGo, inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I will recover of this sickness.\u201d<br><br>3 But Yahweh\u2019s[a] angel said to Elijah the Tishbite, \u201cArise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and tell them, \u2018Is it because there is no God[b] in Israel, that you go to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? 4 Now therefore Yahweh says, \u201cYou will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but you will surely die.\u201d\u2019\u201d Then Elijah departed.<br><br>5 The messengers returned to him, and he said to them, \u201cWhy is it that you have returned?\u201d<br><br>6 They said to him, \u201cA man came up to meet us, and said to us, \u2018Go, return to the king who sent you, and tell him, \u201cYahweh says, \u2018Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you send to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but you will surely die.\u2019\u201d\u2019\u201d<br><br>7 He said to them, \u201cWhat kind of man was he who came up to meet you, and told you these words?\u201d<br><br>8 They answered him, \u201cHe was a hairy man, and wearing a leather belt around his waist.\u201d<br><br>He said, \u201cIt\u2019s Elijah the Tishbite.\u201d<br><br>9 Then the king sent a captain of fifty with his fifty to him. He went up to him; and behold,[c] he was sitting on the top of the hill. He said to him, \u201cMan of God, the king has said, \u2018Come down!\u2019\u201d<br><br>10 Elijah answered to the captain of fifty, \u201cIf I am a man of God, then let fire come down from the sky, and consume you and your fifty!\u201d Then fire came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty.<br><br>11 Again he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. He answered him, \u201cMan of God, the king has said, \u2018Come down quickly!\u2019\u201d<br><br>12 Elijah answered them, \u201cIf I am a man of God, then let fire come down from the sky, and consume you and your fifty!\u201d Then God\u2019s fire came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty.<br><br>13 Again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. The third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and begged him, and said to him, \u201cMan of God, please let my life, and the life of these fifty of your servants, be precious in your sight. 14 Behold, fire came down from the sky, and consumed the last two captains of fifty with their fifties. But now let my life be precious in your sight.\u201d<br><br>15 Yahweh\u2019s angel said to Elijah, \u201cGo down with him. Don\u2019t be afraid of him.\u201d<br><br>Then he arose, and went down with him to the king. 16 He said to him, \u201cYahweh says, \u2018Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? Therefore you will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but you will surely die.\u2019\u201d<br><br>17 So he died according to Yahweh\u2019s word which Elijah had spoken. Jehoram began to reign in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, because he had no son. 18 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, aren\u2019t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</span>"}}, {"date": "", "location": {"icon": "//uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/cd9a2b6c7eda90f59f8a7b5210906da8/elijah-elisha/_images/Elisha & Elijah.png", "iconSize": [48, 28.8], "lat": 32.030556, "line": true, "lon": 35.225, "use_custom_marker": true, "zoom": 12}, "media": {"caption": "Gilgal means \"circle\" probably referring to a circular altar (source: Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary, 2015).", "credit": "Bukvoed, CC BY 4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0>, via Wikimedia Commons", "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Gilgal-Argaman-691.jpg"}, "text": {"headline": "Gilgal - where God makes you a new person", "text": "<span>Gilgal (17 miles from Samaria)<br><br><b>2 Kings 2:1</b><br>When Yahweh was about to take Elijah up by a whirlwind into heaven, Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.</span>"}}, {"date": "", "location": {"icon": "//uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/cd9a2b6c7eda90f59f8a7b5210906da8/elijah-elisha/_images/Elisha & Elijah.png", "iconSize": [48, 28.8], "lat": 31.922778, "line": true, "lon": 35.241389, "use_custom_marker": true, "zoom": 12}, "media": {"caption": "\"Joshua passing the river Jordan with the ark of the covenant.\" Bethel means \"house of God\"; the ark of the covenant was kept in Bethel early in the period of the judges (source: Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary, 2015).", "credit": "Benjamin West, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons", "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Benjamin_West_-_Joshua_passing_the_River_Jordan_with_the_Ark_of_the_Covenant_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"}, "text": {"headline": "Bethel - place of worship and surrender", "text": "<span>Bethel (8 miles from Gilgal)<br><br><b>2 Kings 2:2-3</b><br>2 Elijah said to Elisha, \u201cPlease wait here, for Yahweh has sent me as far as Bethel.\u201d<br><br>Elisha said, \u201cAs Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.\u201d So they went down to Bethel.<br><br>3 The sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, \u201cDo you know that Yahweh will take away your master from your head today?\u201d<br><br>He said, \u201cYes, I know it.
